# Algorithms for Data Science

Graduate-level coursework from **Algorithms for Data Science**, completed as part of the **M.S. in Data Science** program at **New College of Florida**. The course covers rigorous algorithm design, computational complexity analysis, and advanced data structures — with implementations in Python emphasizing both theoretical correctness and empirical performance.

## Course Overview

This is a graduate-level course requiring formal analysis of algorithmic efficiency, implementation of classical and applied algorithms, and benchmarking of runtime performance against theoretical bounds. Topics span core computer science fundamentals through applied data science algorithms including graph theory and network flow.

## Assignments

### 1. Peak Finding
Divide-and-conquer peak finding in 1D and 2D arrays. Implements linear scan O(N), binary search O(log N), brute-force 2D O(N²), and optimized 2D O(N log N) approaches — with comparison counting and runtime benchmarking.

### 2. Asymptotic Analysis and Complexity Visualization
Formal asymptotic growth analysis across common complexity classes (log N, √N, N, N log N, N², N³, 2^N). Includes bubble sort as a reference, function intersection computation with SciPy, and Matplotlib visualizations comparing theoretical vs. empirical runtimes.

### 3. Heapsort
Max-heap construction and in-place heap sort with O(N log N) time complexity. Benchmarks sorting performance against theoretical N log N growth curves.

### 4. Priority Queues
Max-heap-based priority queue applied to a graduate course enrollment system. Students are ranked by level (graduate/undergraduate/auditor), major, year, and registration date — sorted via heap sort to select the top 25 applicants.

### 5. Hash Tables and Collision Resolution
Hash table with linear probing and double hashing (mod 3011, mod 1021 into a prime-sized table). Measures lookup performance across test keys with histogram visualization of collision behavior.

### 7. Weighted Graphs and Network Flow
Directed weighted graph analysis using NetworkX: adjacency matrices, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, path enumeration with probability calculation, graph diameter via eccentricity, and maximum flow via Ford-Fulkerson.
